# GRANDstack Starter for Next.js

This project is a starter for building a [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io) ([GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com), [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com)) application using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) instead of the original [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) example available at [https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter](https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter).

## Getting started

### Create a Next.js app from scratch

```sh
# Navigate to your desired directory (such as app)
$ npm init  # Creates a package.json with common values for your app

# Install required Next.js and React dependencies
$ npm install next react react-dom

# Create a pages directory
$ mkdir pages

# Create a default page
$ cd pages
$ touch index.js
```

Create a simple default page:

```jsx
// app/pages/index.js
const DefaultPage = () => {
  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>
}

export default DefaultPage
```

Once you have created the default page, you can now run your app with:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

You should be able to view your application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). ðŸ¤“

## Static files

The `public` folder in your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app can be used to serve whatever assets you desire (e.g. `app/public/logo.png` would be available at http://localhost:3000/logo.png)

## Back-end API

One benefit of developing with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is that any files contained within your `pages/api` folder will be separate serverless functions.

In our case, we have two serverless functions that we are exposing:

- `ping` - Displays a simple message to verify our serverless functions are online
- `graphql` - This is the GraphQL endpoint our application and our GraphIQL IDE will use

For more details, please refer to [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction)

### GraphQL

You can explore your GraphQL schema using the GraphIQL IDE - available at [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql)

### Ping

To verify your back-end API is running, you should be able to visit [http://localhost:3000/api/ping](http://localhost:3000/api/ping) and see a response.

## Third-party services

### Apollo GraphQL

This project has an example [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) server up and running at `/api/graphql`

If you are running this project locally, you can view the [GraphIQL IDE](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql) at [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql)

### Vercel

This project has been configured to automatically deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using the [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/github) integration.

#### Environment variables

We can define the environment variables we would like to use for our `Production`, `Preview`, and `Development` environments. Navigate to your [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project settings and define your environment variables as you'd like ðŸ¤“

Please see [https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) and/or [https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for details on defining environment variables for your application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
